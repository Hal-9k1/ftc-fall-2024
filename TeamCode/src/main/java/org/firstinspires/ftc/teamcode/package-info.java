/**
 * Contains, mostly in subpackages, all robot controlling logic.

 * <p>This package directly contains utility classes (since there aren't enough yet to warrant a
 * subpackage) and most importantly the {@link RobotController} class, which controls the robot
 * according to a stack of {@link org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.layer.Layer}s. Everything else to
 * do with controlling the robot lives in subpackages here.
