/**
 * Wrappers for hardware interfaces that provide additional computations.
 * These abstract away bare actuators and sensors to control larger mechanisms. They are not
 * {@link org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.layer.Layer}s and should not be controlled using
 * {@link org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.task.Task}s. They should carry little state and typically
 * should not provoke changes to underlying actuators themselves. If you find yourself writing a
 * class in this package with an "update" method, consider whether it might be better expressed as a
 * Layer; classes here should primarily get information about and directly control mechanisms built
 * from actuators.
